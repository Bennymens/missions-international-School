            Thank you for your interest in Mission International School.
          </p>

          <p>
            MIS offers a curriculum based on the Cambridge International Early
            Years, Cambridge Primary & Secondary programme leading to the IGCSE
            and A Level examination. We also have a Pearson BTEC pathway in
            Music and Creative Media for students aged 14 years and above (i.e.
            Form 4 upwards).
          </p>

          <p>
            Infant School pupils (Nursery - Class 2) follow the Cambridge Early
            Years curriculum, learning Numeracy, Literacy, History, Geography,
            and specialist subject experiences in Art, P.E., Computing, Music,
            and French. The curriculum is holistic, focusing on the whole child
            and connecting their development with the host country.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also provide an enriching boarding experience for students in
            Form Two - Upper Sixth Form (Grade 7 - 12). It is a weekly boarding
            offering where students are required to return home at the end of
            each week (Fridays) and report back to the boarding house on Sunday
            afternoons (ready for the start of each school week). However,
            weekend stays are planned throughout the school year for the
            purposes of extended learning (academic support), Duke of Edinburgh
            Award activities, experiential learning opportunities, etc. These
            take place on selected weekends, for which parents are notified in
            advance. Students do not go home but to stay at the boarding house.
          </p>

                parent(s) in attendance and a thorough evaluation of previous
                school reports. These will include a confidential report
                obtained from an applicant's current school Principal. The aim
                is to determine the school's ability to fully cater to the needs
                of the child. Entrance assessments are administered in
                February/March before the academic year starts in September.
                Late admissions for international applicants may take place
                between August and December as required. Please note the
                following in relation to the administration of entry
